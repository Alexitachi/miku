# miku - Ebook Library|Forum
Miku is an open project: the software is open, the data are open,the documentation is open, and I welcome your contribution.
Whether you fix a typo,add a book, or write a widget--it's all welcome. I need a small team of fantastic programmers
because i can't do it alone!.
One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.
